Model description       : Hopefully a generic action hero.  I would love to see
                          more skins made for him.  Any takers?


Other info              : Suislide came up with the unique weapon idea.  Also made the AQ2 vwep models.
                          For skinners:  I highly suggest you dont do anything about the weapon skins.
                          Just deal with the fact that the arms are black.  A lot can still be done in
                          spite of that fact.  If you do come up with better arm skins... give 'em to me
                          to check out and we'll see what can be done.
